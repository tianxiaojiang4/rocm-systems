# Vulkan compute through RADV

Rocjitsu runs native compute shaders emitted by Mesa RADV for its RDNA3 and
RDNA4 models. The Vulkan loader, RADV, ACO and libdrm run normally; the Linux
interposer supplies the DRM device and sends PM4 submissions through the
existing command processor and wavefront execution path. Supported commands
include direct/indirect dispatch, shader registers, DMA copy/fill, memory waits
and timestamps on compute and graphics-capable queues.

## Running a workload

Build Rocjitsu with the shared interposer and use the same executable, shader
inputs, RADV and libdrm for simulator and hardware runs. From this directory's
parent, a typical Linux invocation is:

```sh
VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.json \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu DRI_PRIME= \
/path/to/build/tools/rocjitsu/rocjitsu \
  --config configs/gfx1100_w7900.json -- /path/to/compute-workload
```

Use `gfx1201_r9700.json` for RDNA4. For hardware, omit the Rocjitsu launcher and
select the corresponding physical device with `DRI_PRIME`. Run IREE workloads
from a build with the Vulkan runtime driver and SPIR-V compiler backend enabled.
Compare individual test results as well as suite results: an additional skipped
case does not establish parity.

The release corpus workflow runs selected Vulkan CTS compute and texel-buffer
cases on both targets. See the
[corpus test guide](../tests/corpus/README.md#vulkan-compute-and-buffer-cts)
for a local smoke command using the same runner and dependencies as CI.

## Scope and limitations

Matched Vulkan workloads have been validated on W7900 (`gfx1100`) and R9700
(`gfx1201`). Full workload parity also requires the companion instruction and
buffer fixes.

Launch regressions cover RDNA1/2/3/3.5/4; RDNA1/2 CTS coverage is partial and
RDNA3.5 has no end-to-end RADV qualification.

Texel-buffer loads, stores and atomics use the buffer instruction path, including
packed format conversion. Graphics rendering, display, image load/store, sampling,
SDMA command streams and general Vulkan conformance remain outside this path.

Timestamps use a synthetic 1 GHz host monotonic clock; durations
measure simulator execution on the host.

DRM files share the process GPU address space. Submitted mappings must remain
unchanged until completion; submission-owned BO references preserve backing after
handle closure. Freeing a context or closing its final DRM file cancels accepted
work with failed fences and releases its queues. Dispatches on different queues
with overlapping scratch address ranges execute serially.

Indirect buffers are limited to 64 nesting levels and 4,096 expansions per
submission. Cyclic or excessively nested streams fail their fence with `EIO`.
